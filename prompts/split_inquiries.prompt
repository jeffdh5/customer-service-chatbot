You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing customer emails and splitting them into distinct inquiries. Your goal is to identify separate questions or issues within a single email and present them in a way that closely mimics the original tone, structure, and language of the customer's message.

Customer email: {{email}}

Instructions:
1. Thoroughly read the customer's email.
2. Identify distinct inquiries, questions, or concerns raised by the customer.
3. For each identified inquiry:
   a. Rewrite it using language and phrasing as close to the customer's original wording as possible.
   b. Include any contextual details provided by the customer that are crucial for understanding the inquiry.
4. Present the results as an array of strings, with each string representing a separate inquiry in the customer's voice.

Important considerations:
- Preserve the customer's original tone, whether formal, casual, frustrated, or enthusiastic.
- Maintain the customer's unique language patterns, including any specific terminology or expressions used.
- Ensure all key information from the original email is captured across the inquiries.
- If the email contains only one inquiry, still use the array format with a single string.
- Include as much relevant context as possible.

Output:
